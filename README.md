# bash-autocomplete-from-file
Scripts for bash autocompleting the host names from a static file

The .txt and .sh files are assumed to be in ~/bin aka ${HOME}/bin/. The files without an extension are in ~/.config/bash_completion.d/.
The functions defined in the files in ~/.config/bash_completion.d/ have to be unique.
It is also assumed that ~/bin is on your $PATH
